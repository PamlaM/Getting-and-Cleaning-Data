# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Welcome to my analysis of the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Data Set as defined in the following publication:
Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012
## Files included in this Repo
* This Readme document
* A Codebook - includes the original readme.txt
* run_analysis.R - the R script which analyses the HAR Data
* TidyData.txt - the output of the analysis  

## To test the script...
This script was developed and tested using RStudio in a Windows 10 environment.
The code will:
* create a subdirectory for the anaylsis
* unzip the files to that subdirectory
* analyse the data
* write the output file to your working directory
* then clean up environment variables and delete the subdirectory

## When you're done, 
just delete from your directory
* run_analysis.R
* TidyData.txt and 
* remove tidydata from your environment
